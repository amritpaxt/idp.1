# DigiEdu – Blockchain & AI Based Education Credential System (Frontend Prototype)

DigiEdu is a **frontend prototype** inspired by DigiLocker, enhanced with **Blockchain trust principles** and **AI/ML intelligence** for secure, decentralized, and learner-centric education credential management.

This project demonstrates **what comes after DigiLocker** — a system where:
- Institutions issue trusted credentials
- Learners own their data
- Verifiers can instantly check authenticity
- AI adds intelligence on top of credible data

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Traditional education data management systems suffer from:
- Credential fraud and forgery
- Centralized control and single points of failure
- Duplicate and fake document uploads
- Lack of intelligent data analysis
- Limited learner ownership

While DigiLocker solves **storage**, it does not fully address:
- Decentralization
- Intelligence (AI insights)
- User-controlled access

## 💡 Proposed Solution

DigiEdu combines:

### 🔗 Blockchain (Trust Layer)
- Immutable credential hashing
- Decentralized verification
- No single central authority
- Tamper-proof records

### 🤖 AI / ML (Intelligence Layer)
- Fraud detection
- Anomaly detection
- Pattern recognition
- Credential usage analytics

> **Blockchain ensures credible data, AI ensures credible insights.**

## 🧱 System Architecture (Conceptual)

### 1️⃣ Credential Issuance
- Institution generates a certificate
- Certificate hash (SHA-256) is created
- Hash is stored on blockchain

### 2️⃣ Credential Ownership
- Student stores the original certificate
- Blockchain stores only the hash (not the file)

### 3️⃣ Verification
- Verifier uploads certificate
- Hash is recomputed
- Blockchain hash comparison ensures authenticity

## 🖥️ Frontend Features (Implemented)

- Role-based login (Student / Institution / Verifier)
- Student dashboard with credential upload
- Hash simulation for blockchain storage
- Verification simulation (valid / tampered detection)
- AI insights section (fraud & anomaly indicators)
- Clean, professional UI with responsive design

> ⚠️ This is a **frontend-only prototype** for academic and demonstration purposes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- UI inspired by real-world credential platforms
